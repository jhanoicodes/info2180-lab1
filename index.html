        <p>I would like to become an ethical hacker in the future so that I can make boat loads of money. 
            I believe that Web Development will help me to learn skills and gain knowledge that will be essential for my future job in cybersecurity.
            These skills include learning to code in HTML, using CSS as well as utilizing languages such as JavaScript.</p>
